## Steps:
1. Write a program that asks the user "What is the capital of France?" and waits for their response.
2. If the user's answer is correct (i.e., "Paris"), the program should print a message saying the answer is correct.
3. If the answer is incorrect, the program should print a message saying the answer is wrong.

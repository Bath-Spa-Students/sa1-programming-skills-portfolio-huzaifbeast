### Advanced Requirements:
Ignore Capitalization: Modify your program to accept answers regardless of the capitalization (e.g., "paris", "Paris", and "PaRis" should all be considered correct).
Multiple Questions: Extend the program into a quiz that asks for the capitals of 10 European countries. Provide feedback for each question.

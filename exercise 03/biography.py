"""
In this exercise, you'll create a program that stores and prints your name, hometown, and age to the console using a Python dictionary.

### Steps:
1. Store the information (name, hometown, and age) as key-value pairs in a dictionary.
2. Print the values on separate lines using a single `print()` statement.
3. Use variables with appropriate data types for each piece of information.

# 1 : storing info in dictionary 
Admin_info = {
    "name": "Huzaifa",        # type  string
    "hometown": "Dubai",      # type string
    "age": 19                # type  integer
}

# 2 : printing in the same line 
print(f"name: {Admin_info['name']}\nhometown: {Admin_info['hometown']}\nage: {Admin_info['age']}")
